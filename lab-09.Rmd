### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(tidymodels)
library(openintro)
?evals
view(evals)
```

### Exercise 1
Positively skewed, mean = 4.18, max = 5, 
Students tend to give positive evaluations for their professors as the data is positively skewed.


```{r score}
evals2 <- ggplot(evals, aes(x = score))
evals2 + geom_histogram(bins = 30, color = "white", fill = "blue") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(score)), 
             linetype = "dashed", size = 0.6)
summary(evals$score)

```

### Exercise 2

...

Add exercise headings as needed.
